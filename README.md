<h3>What it's about</h3> <br>
Application written with a view to practising the Selenium framework. The user stores the necessary data in a configuration file, from where it is then downloaded into the application.

Unfortunately, some restrictions, such as Captcha, cannot be overridden, but the application was created mainly to practice and use Selenium (performing operations, waiting for elements to load, mouse and keyboard operations, passing options to browsers).

Even so, it will still fill the login form field automatically on popular social media sites:
 - <b>Facebook <br>
 - Instagram <br>
 - LinkedIn <br>
 - Reddit <br>
 - TikTok <br>
  </b>


Unfortunately, I wasn't able to get around Twitter, whose security features blocked the ability to log in for me using automation (the window wouldn't load properly).

The application supports 3 different browsers - Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox and Microsoft Edge. Each is attached in incognito mode and maximises the browser window, accepts -- if necessary -- cookies and then proceeds to automatically fill in the form on the pages.

<b>In the future, I will want to add tests created with PyTest to it, so it could be a good practice environment for me :).</b>
